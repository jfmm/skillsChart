   <h1>E-learning Tracker</h1>
   
   <p>The following visualization is a simple but effective way to illustrate my learning progress. By comparing the relative proficiency among various subject areas, I can easily determine which skill or subject I've spent most of my time studying, and which areas need my attention as I continue my education.</p>
   <p>The data is collected by <a href="https://teamtreehouse.com/" target="_blank">Treehouse</a>, an online coding learning platform I highly recommend, and made accesible via their studen API endpoint.</p>
